# Tutoring

In these repositories I have all the worksheets I've designed to help tutor students through math courses at the University of Alberta. The calculus folder contains all the content for first year cal courses (MATH 134/144/154, MATH 136/146/156, MATH 100, MATH 101). The elementary algebra folder contains the worksheets and solutions I've created for MATH 160.

# Additional Resources

These repos just contain the worksheets I create so there may be a lot of missing information in them that I teach in person. There are a lot of resources online that cover more of the content that are free and online.
